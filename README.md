# Japanese-Helper

![Demo](https://github.com/searene/japanese-helper/blob/master/demo/demo.gif)

This is an Anki addon that helps you add audio and pitch accents to cards. It fetches the data from jotoba.de.

Notice that Jotoba.de doesn't have all the audio or pitch accents for all the words, so sometimes it may fail to fetch the data. In that case, you may need to search for the audio/pitch accent online manually or use other add-ons.

Open a new issue at [GitHub](https://github.com/searene/japanese-helper/issues) if you encounter any bugs or have some suggestions. You can also contact me via email at mycityofsky@gmail.com.

Feel free to create pull requests if you are interested in the project and know how to code.
